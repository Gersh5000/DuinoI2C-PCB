# Duino Coin Mining PCB Design

Welcome to this repository! This repository contains an EasyEDA project and Gerber PCB files designed specifically for Duino Coin Mining using an ESP8266 and up to 20 ATTiny85 microcontrollers.

This repository includes:

EasyEDA Project (ZIP): The schematic and PCB design files in EasyEDA format.

Gerber PCB Files (ZIP): The Gerber files required for PCB manufacturing.

## Features

Duino Coin Mining: The PCB design is tailored for Duino Coin mining using the ESP8266 microcontroller.
ATTiny85 Support: The design supports up to 20 ATTiny85 microcontrollers, enabling you to run multiple mining tasks simultaneously.
Compact and Efficient: Optimized for performance and compactness, perfect for small-scale, low-power mining operations.

### Folder Structure

/EasyEDA_project.zip: A zip archive containing the EasyEDA project files (schematic and PCB).
/Gerber_DuinoI2C_PCB.zip: A zip archive containing the Gerber files for PCB manufacturing. 

### Design Inspiration

This PCB design was inspired by the work of [JK-Rolling's DuinoI2C_ESP](https://github.com/JK-Rolling/DuinoI2C_ESP). Their repository provided valuable insights and guidance for the development of this design, especially in terms of utilizing the ESP8266 and the ATTiny85 chips for Duino Coin mining.

#### Very important notice: CHECK IF YOUR COMPONENTS (OR COMPONENTS YOU ARE PLANING TO USE) MATCH FOOTPRINTS ON A PCB BEFORE PLACING A MANUFACTURE ORDER. It is easier to edit pcb slightly then to source a hard-to-find component.
